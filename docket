1. To begin with:
• Install Docker Desktop (Make sure you got wsl updated in your device (Win 11 / Win 
10))
• Install node.js (Make sure you install it with admin privileges). Check if node is 
installed using ‘npm –version’ cmd.
2. Building a node.js server application:
• Create a simple server application using node.js. 
• From a new directory, create a file called index.js. Run ‘npm init’ cmd. Check if the 
package.json and package-lock.json are added into the directory.
• Run ‘npm i express’ to install express dependency for building server.
• Write configuration code in the index.js file for a simple server. Expose a port (3000)
and an endpoint (“/”).
• Run the server application by running ‘node index.js’
3. Check if the server is running on the exposed port from the browser by running the 
command ‘node index.js’.
4. Then, to containersie/dockerise application:
• Open docker desktop to start running the docker engine
• Go to the working directory of the server application, and run ‘docker init’ and 
specify the configuration settings
• Check if the files are added to your directory such as DockerFile, compose.yaml, 
dockerIgnore.
• Go to compose.yaml file, and configure the port mapping as per your needs 
(localPort: containerPort)
5. Running the docker container:
• Run the ‘docker compose --up build’ command. Check if the container is running in
the Docker Desktop application.
• Now visit the port you have exposed as per the config in compose.yaml. Check if the 
application is being run in your device from docker container.
6. To stop the application, run “Ctrl+C”
